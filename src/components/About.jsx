          This project explores how digital technology can enhance fan
          experiences in Nigerian sports. By integrating real-time data feeds,
          community features, and gamified interactions, it aims to bridge the
          gap between clubs and their supporters. The goal is to foster deeper
          loyalty, improve transparency, and create engaging digital ecosystems
          around live matches. This prototype is just the beginning of a
          scalable foundation for fan-centric innovation across leagues.
